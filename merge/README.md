## Merging a csv with a shapefile by a common name
In this tutorial, we will see how to include the data contained in a csv to a shapefile. This is a join usually performed with a common column or name, which should be present in both datasets. In our case, we will use the counties' code of the State of SÃ£o Paulo to include in the shapefile the yield of sugarcane and soybean of five years (2016-2020).
I followed the instructions described [here](https://deepnote.com/@siew-sook-yan/Python-Merge-CSV-and-Shapefile-QPJtLgd5SPW7oVQ1Xryshg).  

The final product is a shapefile with 10 columns, each representing the yield of sugarcane and soybean from a period of 10 years.

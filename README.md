# Basic geoprocessing in python
In this repository you'll find some common preprocessing techniques that we use for managing geospatial datasets.  
- `merge`: Sometimes we have a dataset with information of our inteest and want to represent it spatially, in a map. In this folder you'll learn how to merge the information contained in a csv with a shapefile, using a common name. For this example, I used a shapefile of the counties of SÃ£o Paulo and a csv with the historical sugarcane yield (2016-2020). I merged both datasets by their common column: the countie's numerical code.
